14/05/21 - 

I created the profile page and a results page. Results page observe BMI result for now. Later, in results page user can observe her/him weight, bmi results' history.

I created articles and activity page as simple. Later, some youtube videos will be on articles page and daily activity results will be on activity page.

I created some constant values for widgets I used oftenly. Thus, when I want to change some designing properties I change on only one code block.
